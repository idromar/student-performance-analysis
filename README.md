# Student Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using Python and SQL. The goal is to identify patterns and factors that influence student outcomes, such as study time, test preparation, and subject-specific performance.

This project was completed to practice real-world data analysis skills including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and querying data using SQL.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains student performance data including math, reading, and writing scores, along with demographic and preparation-related variables.

## Key Questions
- How does study time impact student performance?
- Are there differences in scores across subjects?
- What effect does test preparation have on academic outcomes?

## Analysis Process
- Cleaned and prepared raw data for analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis using Python
- Created visualizations to identify trends and patterns
- Wrote SQL queries to compare performance across groups

## Key Findings
- Students with higher study time generally performed better across subjects
- Test preparation was associated with improved reading and writing scores
- Math scores showed the greatest variability among students

## Next Steps
- Add predictive modeling to estimate performance outcomes
- Analyze additional demographic factors
- Expand the dataset for deeper insights
